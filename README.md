# Low-Level Design (LLD) Learning Repository

This repository documents my structured learning journey of **Design Principles** and **Design Patterns in Java**. Each folder demonstrates hands-on implementations through focused tasks that reflect real-world use cases for backend development.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ SOLID Principles

Each folder in this section demonstrates one of the SOLID principles through a clean, practical Java implementation.

| Folder | Principle |
|--------|-----------|
| `solid/srp/` | SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
| `solid/ocp/` | OCP (Open/Closed Principle)
| `solid/lsp/` | LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)
| `solid/isp/` | ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
| `solid/dip/` | DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creational Design Patterns

This section focuses on object creation mechanisms that improve flexibility and reusability.

| Folder | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| `creational/factory/` | Factory
| `creational/abstract-factory/` | Abstract Factory
| `creational/singleton/` | Singleton
| `creational/prototype/` | Prototype
| `creational/builder/` | Builder

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Structural Design Patterns

These patterns deal with object composition and relationships between entities.

| Folder | Pattern | 
|--------|---------|
| `structural/adapter/` | Adapter
| `structural/bridge/` | Bridge
| `structural/composite/`| Composite
| `structural/decorator/ | Decorator
| `structural/facade/` | Facade
| `structural/flyweight/` | Flyweight
| `structural/proxy/` | Proxy.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns focus on how objects interact and behave in different scenarios.

| Folder | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| `behavioral/strategy/` | Strategy  
| `behavioral/observer/` | Observer 
| `behavioral/chain-of-responsibility` | Chain of Responsibility
| `behavioral/command/` | Command 
| `behavioral/interpreter/` | Interpreter 
| `behavioral/iterator/` | Iterator 
| `behavioral/mediator/` | Mediator 
| `behavioral/memento/` | Memento 
| `behavioral/state/` | State 
| `behavioral/template-method/` | Template Method 
| `behavioral/visitor/` | Visitor
