Hands-On Task: Real-World Application of Chain of Responsibility

Objective: Build a customer support request handling system using the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

Scenario
    Imagine a software company has a support system where customers raise different types of issues. Depending on the type and severity of the request, it should be handled by:
    Level 1 Support – handles basic queries (password reset, usage help)
    Level 2 Support – handles technical issues
    Level 3 Support – handles critical system bugs or escalations
    Each level can either handle the request or pass it up the chain if it's too complex.

Task Structure
    1. Create SupportRequest class
    It should contain:
        String issueType (e.g., "general", "technical", "critical")
        String message (a description of the issue)
    2. Create SupportHandler abstract class (or interface)
    This will define:
        A reference to the next handler
        An abstract method handleRequest(SupportRequest request)
    Also define a method: setNextHandler(SupportHandler nextHandler)
    3. Implement the following concrete handlers
    Each should check if it can handle the issue type:
            Level1SupportHandler → handles general
            Level2SupportHandler → handles technical
            Level3SupportHandler → handles critical
        If a handler can't handle the request, it should pass it to the next handler.
        Each handler must log:
            "Level X handled the request: <message>" OR
            "Level X can't handle, passing to next."
    4. Client Code
        Instantiate all 3 support handler levels.
        Link them using setNextHandler(...)
        Create and process 3 SupportRequest objects for each level.

Example Test Case (Inputs)
    new SupportRequest("general", "How do I reset my password?");
    new SupportRequest("technical", "App crashes when I upload a file.");
    new SupportRequest("critical", "System outage! Clients can't access data.");

Expected Output (Sample)
    Level 1 handled the request: How do I reset my password?
    Level 1 can't handle, passing to next.
    Level 2 handled the request: App crashes when I upload a file.
    Level 1 can't handle, passing to next.
    Level 2 can't handle, passing to next.
    Level 3 handled the request: System outage! Clients can't access data.
