Hands-On Task

Objective: Implement an Iterator Pattern for a SongCollection class that stores songs (title + artist) and allows iteration.

Instructions:
    Create a Song class (with title and artist).
    Create an Iterator interface and a SongIterator implementation
    Create a SongCollection class that:
    Stores songs in an array or list.
    Has addSong() and createIterator() methods.
    Use it in a Main class to:
    Add 3â€“5 songs.
    Iterate and print: Now playing: {title} by {artist}

Boundaries:
    No need to use java.util.Iterator; implement your own.
    Your iterator must work independently of the collection.
