Hands-On Task
Task Name: Air Traffic Control System
Objective: Implement a mediator pattern where different flights (colleagues) communicate through an Air Traffic Control mediator. When one flight lands, others should be notified they must wait.

Boundaries:
    Flights must not talk to each other directly.
    Flights notify the ATC when they want to land.
    ATC coordinates who can land.

Expected Outcome: When a flight requests landing:
    If runway is free, ATC allows landing.
    All other flights are notified to wait.
