Hands-on Task â€“ Memento Pattern

Objective: Implement a drawing tool where the user can add shapes, and undo recent actions.

Requirements:
    Define a Canvas class with a list of shapes (Strings: e.g., "Circle", "Square").
    The canvas should:
        Add shapes.
        Display current drawing.
        Be able to save its state as a Memento.
        Be able to restore to any previous state.
    Implement a CanvasHistory (Caretaker) to maintain the stack of Mementos.
    Show undoing two steps in the main method.

Restrictions:
    Do not use built-in serialization or deep cloning. Use proper Memento design only.
    Ensure encapsulation: Caretaker should not inspect or modify internal content.
