Hands-on Task: Ticket Booking State Machine

Objective:
   Design a ticket booking system with the following states:
    BookingStartedState → Allows user to select seats.
    PaymentProcessingState → Accepts payment.
    TicketIssuedState → Final ticket is issued, no more changes allowed.

Requirements:
    Implement a TicketBookingContext class.
    Implement a BookingState interface and 3 concrete state classes.
    Initial state should be BookingStartedState.
    The book(), pay(), and issue() methods should behave differently in each state.
    Add relevant transitions (e.g., from booking → payment → issued).
