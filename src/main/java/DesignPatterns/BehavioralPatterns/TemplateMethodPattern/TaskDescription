Hands-On Task

Objective:
    Design a "Game Level Loader" system where each game level (EasyLevel, HardLevel) follows this structure:
        Load assets
        Initialize environment
        Spawn enemies
        Display start screen
    The algorithm is fixed, but the steps vary based on the difficulty level.

Your Task Scope:
    Create an abstract GameLevelLoader with a loadLevel() method as the template.
    Override the steps in:
    EasyLevelLoader
    HardLevelLoader
    In your Main class, demonstrate loading both levels using the loadLevel() method.
    Do not modify the overall sequence of steps in the loadLevel() template.
