Hands-on Task: Implement Abstract Factory Pattern for a Notification System

Objective:
You will implement an Abstract Factory Pattern to create different types of notifications (Email, SMS, and Push) in Basic and Premium variants.

Task Instructions
    Define Abstract Product Interfaces
        Create three interfaces for different notification types:
            IEmailNotification
            ISMSNotification
            IPushNotification
        Each interface should have a send(String message) method.

    Implement Concrete Product Classes
        Implement two sets of concrete classes for each notification type:
            Basic variant
            BasicEmailNotification
            BasicSMSNotification
            BasicPushNotification
            Premium variant
            PremiumEmailNotification
            PremiumSMSNotification
            PremiumPushNotification
        Each class should implement its respective interface and print an appropriate message.

    Create an Abstract Factory Interface
        Define an interface INotificationFactory with methods:
            IEmailNotification createEmailNotification();
            ISMSNotification createSMSNotification();
            IPushNotification createPushNotification();
        This factory will be responsible for creating families of notifications.

    Implement Concrete Factory Classes
        Implement two concrete factories:
            BasicNotificationFactory → Creates basic notifications.
            PremiumNotificationFactory → Creates premium notifications.
            Each factory should implement INotificationFactory and return the appropriate product instances.
        Implement the Client Code
            Ask the user whether they want Basic or Premium notifications.
            Ask for the notification type (Email, SMS, or Push).
            Use the Abstract Factory to create and send the notification.

Expected Output
    Select Notification Type (Email/SMS/Push): Email
    Select Variant (Basic/Premium): Premium
    Sending Premium Email: Your premium email is sent!

    Select Notification Type (Email/SMS/Push): SMS
    Select Variant (Basic/Premium): Basic
    Sending Basic SMS: Your basic SMS is sent!

Constraints
    Follow SOLID principles.
    No direct instantiation of concrete products (new BasicEmailNotification() should only happen inside the factories).
    The client should only interact with the abstract factory and the product interfaces.
