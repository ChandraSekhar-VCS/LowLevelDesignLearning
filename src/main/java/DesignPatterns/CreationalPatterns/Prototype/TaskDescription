Problem Statement:
    You're building a system where you need to frequently clone Book objects in a library catalog. Each book has:
        title (String)
        author (String)
        List<String> tags (e.g., "Fiction", "Science", etc.)
    Since each book has a list of tags, you must implement deep copy so cloned books do not share the same tags list in memory.

Your Task:
    Create a Prototype interface
    Method: Book cloneBook();
    Create a Book class that implements this Prototype interface
        Fields: title, author, List<String> tags
        Add a constructor to initialize the fields.
        Add addTag(String tag) and showDetails() methods
        Implement the cloneBook() method to return a deep copy of the Book.
    Client Class
        Create one original book object with some tags.
        Clone it to a new book.
        Add new tags to the cloned book only.
        Show both books to verify deep copying (i.e., changing one’s tags doesn’t affect the other).

Constraints:
    Don’t use any external libraries for cloning.
    Ensure the tags list is copied deeply.
    You must use proper object-oriented principles.
    Follow naming and access modifiers properly.
