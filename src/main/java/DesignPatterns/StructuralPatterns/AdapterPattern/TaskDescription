Hands-On Task: Adapter Pattern with Documentation

Problem Statement:
You're building a media player. It supports MP3 playback natively, but now you want to extend support for MP4 and VLC formats. Instead of changing your core player, you'll use the Adapter Pattern to add support for new formats.

Your Task: Implement the following with documentation
1. Target Interface – MediaPlayer
    Declare a method play(String audioType, String fileName)
    This is the interface your client (Main app) expects.
2. Adaptee Classes – VlcPlayer and Mp4Player
    Each class should implement a new interface AdvancedMediaPlayer
    Each one supports only its specific format.
3. Adapter Class – MediaAdapter
    Implements MediaPlayer
    Internally uses VlcPlayer or Mp4Player based on the audio type.
4. Concrete Class – AudioPlayer
    Implements MediaPlayer
    Plays MP3 by default.
    Uses MediaAdapter to play other formats.
5. Client – Main
    Test with .mp3, .vlc, and .mp4 formats.
    Print appropriate messages for unsupported formats.
