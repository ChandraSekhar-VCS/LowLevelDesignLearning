Hands-on Task

Objective: Simulate an Online Learning System with a Facade to simplify the course-enrollment process.

Subsystems to Create:
    CourseService – Registers course
    PaymentService – Makes payment
    NotificationService – Sends confirmation email
    StudentService – Updates student profile

Your Facade Class:
    LearningPlatformFacade with method:
    enrollInCourse(String courseName, String studentName)
Expected Output:
    Registering course: Java Backend
    Processing payment for: Java Backend
    Sending confirmation email to student: Chandra
    Updating profile for student: Chandra
    Enrollment complete!
Constraints:
    Do NOT use inheritance between subsystem classes
    Keep each subsystem as a separate service class
    No need to build a real payment or email system — just simulate with print statements
