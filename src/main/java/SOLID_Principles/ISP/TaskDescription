Hands-On Task: Implement ISP in a Payment System

Task Instructions:
    Create an interface IPaymentProcessor with methods:
        processCreditCardPayment()
        processDebitCardPayment()
        processUPIPayment()
    Create three classes implementing IPaymentProcessor:
        CreditCardProcessor (Only supports processCreditCardPayment())
        DebitCardProcessor (Only supports processDebitCardPayment())
        UPIPaymentProcessor (Only supports processUPIPayment())

If a class does not support a method, do NOT throw an exception (Avoid ISP violation).
