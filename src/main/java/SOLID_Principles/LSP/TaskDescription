Apply Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in a different scenario.

Task: Apply LSP to Employee Bonuses

Modify your existing Employee bonus system so that:
    Instead of using a single interface IBonusCalculator for all types of employees, create a separate interface for each type of employee (e.g., ManagerBonusCalculator, DeveloperBonusCalculator).
    Ensure that each subclass strictly follows the rules of its superclass/interface without modifying its expected behavior.

âœ… Steps:
    Refactor your existing bonus calculation system so that:
    Each employee type (Manager, Developer) has its own bonus calculation interface.
    The BonusProcessor should accept only IBonusCalculator and not modify any subclass behavior.
    Test the code by creating employees and calculating their bonuses.
