Hands-on Task: Applying SRP in a Real-world Scenario

Task: Refactor an Employee Management System

Objective: Break down an Employee Management System into separate responsibilities.

Instructions:

    Create an EmployeeDataHandler class that only handles storing and retrieving employee data.
    Create an EmployeeSalaryCalculator class that calculates and updates salary.
    Create an EmployeeReportGenerator class that generates a report for employees.
    Write a Main class where you:
        Create Employee objects.
        Use the separate classes for handling data, salary, and report generation.
